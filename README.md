# Styling demo
## Styling Text
You can style the text using several inline cues. For example, texts can be **bold** or *italicized*, **_or both if it's extremely important._** 
<br/>
~~I am always right~~ And sometimes we might make some mistakes, so the strikethrough is also available. 
<br/>
You can also do <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>, and insert quotes if you want to. Because why not? Like a great man once said 
> You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take
<br/>
So have fun! 

## Quoting code

```
this is what a block of code looks like
SELECT * FROM SAMPLE_TABLE;
```

you can also quote `inline code` like this

This README is built following [this style guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Lists
### Ordered list
  1. this is a list
  2. it does really matter what number you type
  100. as long as it's a number
  9. it will show up correctly 
### Unordered lists
  - They can be anything in -, *, +
  + and can also be mixed
    + or nested like this
   
## Tables 
You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.
Tables are a little tricky in .md files, because you need to manually add each row: 

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
